# 🌾 AI Crop Prediction using Climate and Soil Data Analytics

> An end-to-end intelligent crop recommendation system powered by **XGBoost** and a **LLaMA 3 chatbot** — giving smallholder farmers real-time, soil-specific farming guidance.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project combines machine learning and generative AI to help farmers make data-driven crop decisions. Given climate and soil parameters, the system recommends the most suitable crop and provides instant advisory through a conversational AI chatbot.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shrihariniselvakumar/Ai-crop-prediction-.git
cd Ai-crop-prediction-
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your API keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User inputs soil & climate data
        ↓
XGBoost model predicts yield & best crop
        ↓
LLaMA 3 chatbot provides farming advice
        ↓
Streamlit displays results & visualizations
```

1. **EDA Tab** — Upload your dataset; the app auto-generates Water vs Yield charts, correlation heatmaps, and distribution plots
2. **Prediction Tab** — Enter soil type, crop type, irrigation method, and area; XGBoost predicts yield in ton/hectare
3. **AI Insights Tab** — LLaMA 3 via Groq API generates context-aware advisory — fertilizer tips, watering schedules, seasonal guidance
